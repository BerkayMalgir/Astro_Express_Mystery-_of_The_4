_yawns_ Hey, detective. Good evening. #speaker: Doctor #portrait: Doctor 
I can't say it has been a good one, unfortunately. #speaker: Dedective #portrait: Dedective
I admit it's a truly surprising situation. sighs I suppose you have things to discuss with me. #speaker: Doctor #portrait: Doctor 
Indeed, Mr. Ajax. But before that, I'm curious about your professional opinions. I believe you were the one who administered first aid to Mr. Quill before I arrived. Am I mistaken? #speaker: Dedective #portrait: Dedective
I wish I could say so. After all, I am a doctor. However, Mr. Quill was already dead by the time we arrived. #speaker: Doctor #portrait: Doctor  
*[Are you sure about that?] Many patients can go into shock immediately after an accident. 
    For humans, in a sudden and intense danger situation, the body can exhibit a response called "shock." Shock is a state where the body focuses on preserving vital functions and restricts energy. That's true, but such a reaction doesn't make the patient appear completely "dead" and is usually a temporary condition. 

** [It could be] Your description might apply to another species, but what about Mr. Quill? After all, he's a cold-blooded creature. Like some cold-blooded animals, such as snakes, they can play dead to defend themselves when under threat. By appearing dead, they try to confuse or deter their enemies. It might be the case with the Coltrane species. Perhaps he sensed a threat and went into shock to protect himself. But he couldn't recover from it. 
Yes, when snakes play dead, their breathing patterns can change as well. Playing dead snakes typically remain motionless and can slow down their respiration. Their breathing rate can decrease or they can take deeper breaths. This reduces their energy expenditure and gives them the appearance of being dead. However, there's no evidence to suggest this applies to the Coltrane species, unfortunately. While I haven't come across an extensive study on this so far, based on my own findings, I can assure you that such a thing hasn't been observed. 
***I understand. 
**[You're right.] That would be foolish. 
*[Perhaps there were still things you could have done.] Did you examine him thoroughly enough? 
I'm absolutely certain that Mr. Quill's respiration had ceased, detective. I was there long before you arrived. If there's one thing you can be sure of, it's that I spent minutes trying to revive him at his bedside. Your accusation is an insult to my profession. 
 **I apologize, doctor. I'm just trying to make sure.
 You're right. I guess my nerves are on edge. 
***I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm approaching this objectively. You're still a suspect. 
sighs You're right. You're just doing your job, after all. I suppose my nerves are frayed. 
-Alright, what are your general thoughts about Mr. Quill? #speaker: Dedective #portrait: Dedective
It's impossible to say anything for certain. Since I'm in a suspicious position, I can't conduct the necessary examinations thoroughly. I can only provide my initial impressions. During the external examination, I didn't find any signs of trauma or injury. There are no bruises, contusions, or superficial wounds. I didn't observe any noticeable abnormalities in the respiratory system. There are no indications of infection in the trachea or lungs. The heart and circulatory system seem to be functioning normally. #speaker: Doctor #portrait: Doctor 
So, there are no issues? #speaker: Dedective #portrait: Dedective
No, there's a significant abnormality in the lungs. There are findings of widespread damage in the lung tissue. This inflammation and damage could have hindered the normal functioning of the respiratory tract. The cause of the inflammation and damage should be determined through further laboratory analysis. While this provides a significant clue about the cause of death, it's not definitive. It's just a preliminary examination of a few minutes. #speaker: Doctor #portrait: Doctor 
I see. Are there any items I can examine? #speaker: Dedective #portrait: Dedective
Doc: yet. If you want, you can proceed with your work until then. #speaker: Doctor #portrait: Doctor 
Who would you suggest I start with? #speaker: Dedective #portrait: Dedective 
It could be Ms. Vagie. I saw her heading towards the bar. #speaker: Doctor #portrait: Doctor  
Alright. It would be great if you could be quick, doctor. Thank you. #speaker: Doctor #portrait: Doctor 
You're welcome, detective. Good luck! #speaker: Doctor #portrait: Doctor
