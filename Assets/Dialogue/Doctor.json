After all, he's a cold-blooded creature. Like some cold-blooded animals, such as snakes, they can play dead to defend themselves when under threat. By appearing dead, they try to confuse or deter their enemies. It might be the case with the Coltrane species. Perhaps he sensed a threat and went into shock to protect himself. But he couldn't recover from it. ","\n","^Yes, when snakes play dead, their breathing patterns can change as well. Playing dead snakes typically remain motionless and can slow down their respiration. Their breathing rate can decrease or they can take deeper breaths. This reduces their energy expenditure and gives them the appearance of being dead. However, there's no evidence to suggest this applies to the Coltrane species, unfortunately. While I haven't come across an extensive study on this so far, based on my own findings, I can assure you that such a thing hasn't been observed.","\n",[["ev",{"^->":"Main.0.c-0.4.c-0.4.0.$r1"},{"temp=":"$r"},"str",{"->":".^.s"},[{"#n":"$r1"}],"/str","/ev",{"*":".^.^.c-0","flg":18},{"s":["^I understand.
